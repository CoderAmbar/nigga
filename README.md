# 🌐 WebScan — Modular Web Vulnerability Scanner

WebScan is a **modular, cross-platform web reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning tool** written in **Python**.  
It performs **passive and safe active analysis** on a target website and generates **professional HTML + JSON reports**.

The project focuses on **OSINT-based detection**, **real-world security tooling concepts**, and **clean modular architecture**, making it suitable for **academic evaluation, learning cybersecurity fundamentals, and portfolio use**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Reconnaissance
- DNS resolution (A / AAAA records)
- WHOIS lookup
- ASN lookup using **ipwhois**
  - ISP / Organization
  - ASN number
  - Registry
  - Country
- CDN detection (Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, etc.)

### 🧠 Technology & CMS Detection
- Web server fingerprinting
- Backend technology detection
- CMS detection:
  - WordPress
  - Joomla
  - Drupal

### 🛡️ Security Analysis
- HTTP security header analysis
- SSL/TLS certificate inspection
- Passive WAF detection (header, cookie & body-based)
- Safe directory enumeration
- Optional async deep directory scanning

### 🐞 Vulnerability Detection
- Server & application CVE lookup (NVD-based)
- CMS-specific CVE detection (even without server version)
- Risk scoring engine (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

### 📸 Visual Intelligence
- Website screenshot capture (Playwright-based)
- Screenshot embedded in HTML report via dropdown

### 📊 Reporting
- Automatically generated:
  - **HTML report** (interactive, collapsible sections)
  - **JSON report** (machine-readable)
- Clean, professional UI suitable for reports & submissions
